# Loop Continuation

The continuation protocol lets you control agent execution when it hits its tool iteration limit. The framework provides the mechanism — consumers provide the logic to approve, decline, or timeout the continuation.

## Setup

Register a `ContinuationProvider` on the agent. The provider is called whenever the agent reaches its `MaxIterations` limit while trying to execute tools. It blocks until the consumer provides a decision.

```go
myAgent := agent.New(llmClient,
    agent.WithMaxIterations(5),
    agent.WithContinuationProvider(
        func(ctx context.Context, req agent.ContinuationRequest) (agent.ContinuationResponse, error) {
            // Present req to the user or apply automated logic
            return agent.ContinuationResponse{
                Decision: agent.ContinuationApprove,
            }, nil
        },
    ),
)
```

Return `agent.ContinuationApprove` inside the response to reset the iteration counter and continue the loop, `agent.ContinuationDecline` to stop execution gracefully, or `agent.ContinuationTimeout` if the wait period expires. If the provider returns `ContinuationDecline` or `ContinuationTimeout`, the agent gracefully cancels any pending tool calls, makes a final LLM call to summarize the interruption, and successfully returns with `FinishReasonMaxIterations`. If the provider function itself returns a Go `error`, the agent halts with an error.

## ContinuationResponse

The provider must return a `ContinuationResponse` struct:

```go
type ContinuationResponse struct {
    Decision         ContinuationDecision // Approve, Decline, or Timeout
    Message          string               // Optional "steering message" to append to the conversation
    DiscardToolCalls bool                 // If true, pending tool calls are skipped
    ToolMessage      string               // Custom error message for skipped tools
}
```

- **Message:** Supply an optional steering message. If the decision is `ContinuationApprove`, this message acts as a steering instruction for the next iteration (e.g., "Please try using the search tool instead"). If `ContinuationDecline` or `ContinuationTimeout`, it overrides the default system halt notification to explain why it was stopped. *Note: Regardless of the decision or whether tools were discarded, the steering message is always appended to the context strictly after the tool execution results (or synthetic error results) to preserve expected LLM request/response sequences.*
- **DiscardToolCalls & ToolMessage:** When approving, you can set `DiscardToolCalls: true` to prevent the pending tools from executing. The agent injects synthetic error results for those tools, optionally using `ToolMessage` (defaults to "Tool execution canceled by user during continuation.").

## ContinuationRequest

The provider receives a `ContinuationRequest` with context about the agent's current state:

```go
type ContinuationRequest struct {
    MaxIterations   int                  // The limit that was reached
    TotalIterations int                  // Total iterations across all continuations
    ToolCalls       []message.ToolCall   // The tools the agent wants to execute next
}
```

## Streaming

In the streaming path (`ChatStream`), an `EventContinuationRequired` event is emitted before the provider blocks. This allows the consumer to present a UI and then unblock the provider:

```go
for event := range myAgent.ChatStream(ctx, "Analyze this large dataset") {
    switch event.Type {
    case types.EventContinuationRequired:
        req := event.ContinuationRequest
        fmt.Printf("Agent reached %d iterations. It wants to call %d tools.\n", req.MaxIterations, len(req.ToolCalls))
        // The provider is blocking — respond via whatever mechanism it uses
    case types.EventContentDelta:
        fmt.Print(event.Content)
    case types.EventComplete:
        fmt.Println("\nDone!")
    }
}
```

A common pattern is to use a channel-based provider that the streaming consumer unblocks, similar to tool confirmation:

```go
type continuationApproval struct {
    response agent.ContinuationResponse
    ch       chan struct{}
}

// In the provider:
// ... wait on channel, return decision ...

// In the stream consumer:
// ... unblock channel with decision ...
```

## Auto-Approve Patterns

The provider is a regular function — implement any continuation logic:

```go
// Always approve (effectively disables max iterations, use with caution!)
agent.WithContinuationProvider(
    func(_ context.Context, _ agent.ContinuationRequest) (agent.ContinuationResponse, error) {
        return agent.ContinuationResponse{Decision: agent.ContinuationApprove}, nil
    },
)

// Approve up to a hard limit
agent.WithContinuationProvider(
    func(ctx context.Context, req agent.ContinuationRequest) (agent.ContinuationResponse, error) {
        if req.TotalIterations >= 20 {
            return agent.ContinuationResponse{Decision: agent.ContinuationDecline}, nil
        }
        return agent.ContinuationResponse{Decision: agent.ContinuationApprove}, nil
    },
)
```
